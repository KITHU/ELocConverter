If you click the My Location button in the options menu, your mobile device's current location will be displayed. 
It will first try to determine the location using GPS satellites. 
If that is unavailable, it will then try to use cell tower and WiFi access points. 
The latitude and longitude coordinates will be displayed in both decimal and D:M:S formats.
When a valid fix has been established, you can then click the Map button in the options menu to 
display your current location in Google Maps.

In the latitude and longitude fields, you can enter coordinates in either decimal or 
D:M:S format and, by clicking the Up/Down buttons, have them converted to the other format. 
When entering coordinates, latitudes south of the equator are negative (up to -90), 
and latitudes north of the equator are positive (up to +90). Similarly, longitudes west
of the prime meridian are negative (up to -180), and longitudes east of the prime meridian are positive (up to +180).

For decimal format, the space between each line of latitude or longitude representing 1° is
divided and expressed as decimals. For example,

36.099199 N 
95.838361 W

is read as 36.099199 degrees north (of the equator), and 95.838361 degrees west (of the prime meridian).

For D:M:S format, the space between each line of latitude or longitude representing 1° is 
divided into 60 minutes, and each minute is divided into 60 seconds (see sexagesimal notation). For example,

36:5:56.12388 N 
95:50:18.10032 W

is read as 36 degrees, 5 minutes, 56.12388 seconds north (of the equator), and 95 degrees, 50 minutes,
18.10032 seconds west (of the prime meridian). An alternative format would look like:

36° 5′ 56.12388″ N 
95° 50′ 18.10032″ W

When valid coordinates have been entered and converted, you can then click the Map button in 
the options menu to display those coordinates in Google Maps.
